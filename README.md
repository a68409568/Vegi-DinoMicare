Created for a school project.
Had to show a picture of the cutest baby animal.
Gotta give it to a tiger cub.

The question is: what are the needs for Seattle? What is an area in which Seattle struggles?
Meanwhile, all students were assigned focus countries to study, mine being Sudan and Australia.
Then, students were requested to identify the strengths of our focus countries.
Using the strengths of one of them, help fill the void for which Seattle struggles.
